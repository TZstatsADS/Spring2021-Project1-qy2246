### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2021

+ Projec title: Would education motivate different racial and ethnical group to participate in the election vote?
+ This project is conducted by Qizhen Yang

+ Project summary: The racial and ethnical conflicts have been one of the most popular topics discussed around our society. Participating the election vote and choosing the skillful president are important ways for different racial/ethnical groups to relieve this pressure. However, not everyone is willing to vote. Therefore, what factors could encourage different racial/ethnical groups to vote? In details, would education motivate different racial and ethnical group to participate in the election vote? Hence, this analysis will focus on answering this question.

+ Main findings:
  1. The proportion of different racial/ethnical groups who voted(registered) was increasing since 1952.
  2. As respondents' education degrees get higher, the proportion of the respondents who votes becomes larger.
  3. People with higher education degrees participate more in election vote than those with a relatively low education degrees.
